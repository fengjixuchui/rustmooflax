# Rustmooflax hypervisor

A PoC version of
[ramooflax](https://github.com/airbus-seclab/ramooflax) written in
Rust back in 2017.

The purpose was to try to write bare-metal software in Rust while
learning language concepts.

This is not a full working version. The hypervisor reaches *vm-exits*
handling.
